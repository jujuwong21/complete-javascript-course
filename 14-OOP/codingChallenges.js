// 1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;
const Car = function (make, speed) {
  this.make = make;
  this.speed = speed;
};

// 2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
Car.prototype.accelerate = function () {
  this.speed += 10;
  console.log(this.speed);
};

// 3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
Car.prototype.brake = function () {
  this.speed -= 5;
  console.log(this.speed);
};
// 4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

// DATA CAR 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
const Car1 = new Car('BMW', 120);
console.log(Car1);
Car1.accelerate();
Car1.accelerate();
Car1.brake();

// DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
const Car2 = new Car('Mercedes', 95);
console.log(Car2);
Car2.brake();

//1. Re-create challenge 1, but this time using an ES6 class;
class CarClass {
  constructor(make, speed) {
    this.make = make;
    this.speed = speed;
  }

  // Instance methods

    console.log(this.speed);
  }
  brake() {
    this.speed -= 5;
    console.log(this.speed);

  }

  //2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6);
  get speedUS() {
    return this.speed / 1.6;
  }
  // 3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6);
  set speedUS(speed) {
    this.speed = speed * 1.6;
  }
}
// 4. Create a new car and experiment with the accelerate and brake methods, and with the getter and setter.
//DATA CAR 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h

// 1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called EV) as a CHILD "class" of Car. Besides a make and current speed, the EV also has the current battery charge in % ('charge' property);
const EV = function (make, speed, charge) {
  Car.call(this, make, speed);
  this.charge = charge;
};
EV.prototype = Object.create(Car.prototype); // link to prototype

// 2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo';
EV.prototype.chargeBattery = function (chargeTo) {
  this.charge = chargeTo;
};

// 3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%';
EV.prototype.accelerate = function () {
  this.speed += 20;
  this.charge -= 1;
  console.log(
    `${this.make} is going at ${this.speed} km/h, with a charge of ${this.charge}%`
  );
};

// 4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when you 'accelerate'! HINT: Review the definiton of polymorphism ðŸ˜‰

// DATA CAR 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%
const tesla = new EV('Tesla', 120, 23);
console.log(tesla);
tesla.chargeBattery(90);

// 1. Re-create challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl' child class of the 'CarCl' class
// 2. Make the 'charge' property private;
// 3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery' methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl' class. They experiment with chining!
